# Online game using my terminal game engine

Very basic game using my terminal game engine. 

It should be very easy to use. Just open two terminals. On one run the server.py in server code and in the other one write sudo python main.py, so you can use keyboard inputs. 

There are no graphics at all, just terminal.

Is built with my own terminal game engine.

## Why did I do this
I built this when I was around 14 years old. I was just curious how could I use my terminal game engine and also wanted to try Sockets.
